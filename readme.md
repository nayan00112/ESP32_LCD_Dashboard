**Introduction**

In today's technology-driven world, real-time monitoring and error resolution have become essential aspects of any system's operation. Ensuring seamless and efficient operation requires immediate identification and resolution of errors. The integration of an ESP32 microcontroller with an I2C LCD display, along with AI-powered software tools, presents an innovative approach to addressing this need.

The project aims to create an AI-assisted error resolution system that can effectively monitor, detect, and resolve errors in real-time. By utilizing a combination of a batch script and a Python script, the system is designed to automate the process of error detection and solution delivery, thus minimizing downtime and improving overall system efficiency.

**Key Components:**
1. **ESP32 Microcontroller**: A versatile microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities that serves as the core of the project.
2. **I2C LCD Display**: A display interfaced with the ESP32 via the I2C protocol to present error messages and solutions.
3. **Batch Script**: Monitors the output of a command, detects errors, and triggers the Python script if any issues arise.
4. **Python Script**: Analyzes error outputs using AI API, retrieves solutions or recommendations, and displays them on the I2C LCD.

By integrating these components, the project seeks to create an efficient and intelligent system capable of monitoring operations, identifying issues, and providing AI-driven solutions in real-time. This automation enhances the resilience and reliability of the overall system, making it more robust and efficient.
